heading : "RIPPLE STUDIO"
description : "Ripple Studio is a project born out of a love for music and an obsession with high quality audio. A passion project in every sense of the term, there is only one person behind this entire operation, for better or for worse. While I would clearly benefit from finding an actual Web developer and branding department that I could pay in gratitude and exposure, I am much more confident in what I can bring as an audio engineer to your project."
expertise_title: "Qualifications"
expertise_sectors: ["Classically trained as a violinist between from the age of three, trading sweet childhood memories for fluency in music theory, working on ear training instead of social skills, but at least I have perfect pitch and you don't.", "Spent all my free time in my teens rebelling against classical music, exchanging Haydn for Hendrix, going from studying the seven modes to practising seven different ways to play the pentatonic, thinking I was Frusciante while the tape was rolling, only to hear more Nick Jonas during playback.", "Cut my losses early as university killed the rock n' roll dream for good to set my sights on a peaceful lifetime of familial comfort, scratching the GAS itch by accumulating a pile of audio gear stacked so high that I could touch the top of the rock n' roll heap if I climbed it, and convincing myself that my life goal was a home theater in a basement.", "Staunch defender of analog gear and the magic of tubes against any and all proof to the contrary, because despite how they might sound exactly the same, this 50$ plugin has no soul compared to my Silver Jubilee. Someone teach Tim Henson how to boomer bend before I ever put on Polyphia again.", "Did I mention analog gear?"]
